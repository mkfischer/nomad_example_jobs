Introduction goes here... (e.g. what you'll learn in this tutorial)

## Challenge

> **OPTIONAL:** If this is covered in the introduction, you don't need to have this
> explicit header.

State the common business challenge. Often times, you can get this information
in the **Background** section of the RFC written by the PM. If not, reach out to
the PM and ask for an example (customer story).

## Solution

> **OPTIONAL:** If this is covered in the introduction, you don't need to have this
> explicit header.

How the product solves this challenge. This is where you explain why you should
read this tutorial.

## Personas

_If applicable_

> **OPTIONAL:** If this is covered in the introduction, you don't need to have this
> explicit section.

If the guided steps involve multiple roles, describe it here.

Example:

The end-to-end scenario described in this tutorial involves two personas:

- `admin` with privileged permissions to write secrets
- `apps` reads the secrets from Vault (client)

## Prerequisites

Example:

- Vault **version 1.2.0** or later
- [Kubernetes comand-line interface (CLI)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io)

> If there is a corresponding Katacoda scenario, be sure to add [`<KatacodaToggleButton />`](https://github.com/hashicorp/learn/blob/master/components/katacoda-embed/README.md) to show the "Show Terminal" button.

**NOTE:** An interactive tutorial is also available if you do not have an environment to perform the steps described in this tutorial. Click the **Show Terminal** button to start.

## Additional discussion

_Optional_

Often times, support or TAMs ask you to add extra discussion to explain little
more about cloud provider specific pitfalls, etc. You can add them here if it
does not fit into anywhere else.

## Next steps

In this section, start with a brief **_summary_** of what you have learned in
this tutorial re-emphasizing the business value. Then provide some guidance on the
next steps to extend the user's knowledge. Briefly describe what the user will do in the next tutorial if the current collection is sequential.

Add cross-referencing links to get more information about the feature (e.g.
product doc page, webinar links, blog post, etc.).
